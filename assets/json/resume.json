[Job Market Paper]","abstract":"This paper examines the relationship between electricity rate plans and EV charging station installations. I match the number of EV charging stations in a zip code area to commercial electricity rate schedules of investor-owned utility companies in the United States from 2015 to 2022. I also simulate electricity bills for each rate schedule that would occur. Then, I use the synthetic control difference-in-differences method and the local projection difference-in-differences method to estimate how newly introduced EV-dedicated electricity tariffs, designed to alleviate the burden of high demand charges, affected electricity bills and EV charging station entries. The results indicate the introduction of EV-dedicated tariffs led to lower electricity demand charges and 1-2 additional charging ports per zip code.","url":"https://jaeyu-jung.github.io/assets/pdf/Jae_Yu_Jung_CV.pdf"}],"languages":[{"language":"Korean","fluency":"Native speaker","icon":""},{"language":"English","fluency":"Fluent","icon":""}],"software":[{"name":"Python","level":"","icon":"fa-solid fa-hashtag","keywords":[]}],"awards":[{"title":"Peter Schmidt Award","date":"Spring 2020","awarder":"Department of Economics, MSU","url":"","summary":""},{"title":"ESPP Doctoral Recruiting Fellowships","date":"Fall 2019","awarder":"Environment Science and Policy Program, MSU","url":"","summary":""}],"references":[{"name":"Soren T.
